This repository contains the python and database files I used to pull and analyze data for my Fullstack Academy Immersive Data Analytics Program capstone project wherein I analyzed the reading and reviewing habits of Good Reads readers of Romance novels.

Files:

  * Rom Books.db - database file used for sql analysis
  * Authors2.ipynb - python file with code used to extract and analyze Good Reads data on authors from json to csv
  * review_spoilers json to csv.ipynb - python file used to extract data on reviews with spoilers
  * romance books & reviews json to csv.ipynb - python file used to extract data on Romance books and submitted reviews
  * romance interactions json to csv.ipynb - python file used to extract data on Romance reader interactions; this csv file was so large that I was unable to use it for my analysis
  * Capstone Analysis1.ipynb - file where the bulk of the python analysis was conducted

 Not Included: Tableau file as it was too large
